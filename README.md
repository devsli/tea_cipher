# The Tiny Encryption Algorithm.
**Version:** `0.1.1`

## Description:
Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) is a block cipher notable for its simplicity of
description and implementation, typically a few lines of code. It was designed
by David Wheeler and Roger Needham of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory; it was
first presented at the Fast Software Encryption workshop in Leuven in 1994, and
first published in the proceedings of that workshop.
