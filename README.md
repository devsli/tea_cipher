# The Tiny Encryption Algorithm
_Simple and fast symmetric-key algorithm cipher_

## Reference:
```python
>>> tea_encrypt(b'barbecue', b'good for nothing')
b'\xa38\x82\xb7\xc6\xa6\xa8c'
>>> tea_decrypt(b'\xa38\x82\xb7\xc6\xa6\xa8c', b'good for nothing')
b'barbecue'

>>> xtea_encrypt(b'american', b'vegetable garden')
b'\x8c\x14\xa5\xab\x1b\n\xc4\xf0'
>>> xtea_decrypt(b'\x8c\x14\xa5\xab\x1b\n\xc4\xf0', b'vegetable garden')
b'american'
```

## Installation:
```sh
git clone git://github.com/amezoure/tea.git
cd tea
python setup.py install
```

## Properties:
TEA has a few weaknesses. Most notably, it suffers from equivalent keys-each key
is equivalent to three others, which means that the effective key size is only
`126` bits. As a result, TEA is **especially bad as a cryptographic hash
function**. TEA is also susceptible to a related-key attack which requires `223`
chosen plaintexts under a related-key pair, with 232 time complexity. Because of
these weaknesses, the XTEA cipher was designed.
